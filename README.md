## Summary
 
#### Simulating the fundamental interactions of Carnivore â€“ Herbivore AI Agents in a procedurally generated environment with the help of Unity Engine

We have 2 kinds of artificial intelligence agents: Carnivore and Herbivore agents. We are simulating fundamental urges such as thirst and hunger for every artificial intelligence agent. Reproduction will be added at a later date.

Carnivore agents are hunting and feeding on herbivore agents. Herbivore agents on the other hand are trying to find plants for food. Both agent types are searching for water on a procedurally generated environment. 

We are using Perlin Noise to create our terrain. We are also procedurally placing objects such as plants,trees and ai agents on the terrain.

After adding a reproduction system our goal is to collect statistics about the simulation. After running the simulation for sufficient amount of time we are expecting to observe realistic behaviors and population numbers from our artificial intelligence agents. In order to observe realistic ecosystem populations we are planning to use real world values for our agents pregnancy duration.  

In the end of the simulation, the metrics we will observe and collect will be enlightening when it comes to understanding the complex behaviors of different creatures on different ecosystems. Those metrics will also shed light to ecosystems populations and the interactions between different creatures and the ecosystem which they live in.
